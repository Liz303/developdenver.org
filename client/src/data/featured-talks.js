		description: `"Do you want to be a Golden God of mobile accessibility? First you are going to need your tools. With the increased usage of mobile devices, it’s critical for development teams to understand how to build mobile applications that don’t obstruct accessibility/usability of individuals with disabilities. Currently the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) addresses a fraction of mobile web and native application-specific issues and largely anchors them to the standards for non-mobile software and web. Putting teams in the difficult position of having to decipher and validate their mobile accessibility approach on their own.

In this talk we will discuss how WCAG can be applied to mobile web and native applications, best practices and an overview into accessibility features and tools available for both android and iOS devices.  After this talk you will see how mobile accessibility is governed by reason unlike bird law. This talk is for developers and testers on teams that are supporting
	native/hybrid apps, but will be helpful for any developer interested in
	building more accessible mobile applications. "`,

		description: `"If you were working a VR food truck, how would you let the simulation know you were ready to leave? Try to walk out the door? Look for a “exit” button? In Job Simulator, you take a bite out of a burrito labeled “quit” - twice to confirm your choice. It’s just one of many ways designers are experimenting with UI design in VR.
In this talk, Senior UX Instructor Nick Anderson will explore the Wild West of VR UI design, from simple floating interfaces to true-to-life, fully integrated experiences. We’ll look at indications of where we can expect these trends to go next, and how it will impact the jobs of UX Designers. Finally, we’ll explore how gamification design plays a role in simulated experiences."`,

		title: 'React ❤ TS: Advanced TypeScript Patterns',
		type: 'talk',
		description: `"Did your team recently decide to rewrite everything in TypeScript? Are you unsure, excited, or generally challenged by how to transition and grow your React application’s codebase in a typed system? Strongly typed React can seem daunting, but it empowers developers with increased speed and confidence in making code changes. It makes code extra readable, avoids bugs, speeds up onboarding, and even spell checks for you!

In this talk we’ll go over some of the techniques that you can use to avoid using \`any\` and build your React application with rock solid types. By implementing strongly typed React patterns we’ll take advantage of TypeScript to enhance your front end skills, improve the quality of your codebase, and build clean and maintainable apps that last. If you're working in TypeScript but struggling with how to add types to the common React patterns you've grown to love, this talk is for you."`,

		description: `"Our industry places an outsize focus on intelligence, and for good reason: we face challenging cognitive problems on a daily basis, and our success is often measured by our ability to solve them. But it took more than raw talent for Tony to become Iron Man; he needed to understand how his inventions were perceived and used before becoming the superhero we know. He brought his perspective into perfect balance, as all things should be.

This conversation will cover the human side of technology and suggest ways to develop and use softer skills to complement your technological talents. You will learn to be a more effective advocate for your users, a more empathetic team member, and more compassionate human being."`,

		description: `“Panic Attack at the Code Review” isn’t just a cool idea for a band name, it’s a real experience many people have had at work. Every business, group and congregation is neurodiverse -- and an estimated 1 in 6 people have a brain disorder. Yet, 68% of employees never discuss mental health with their employer. This is even more common in the tech industry. If you’re a developer, designer, manager or entrepreneur who’s experienced stress, burnout, anxiety or depression, this talk is for you (that’s likely 100% of you reading this!). We’ll discuss why mental health issues are common in the tech industry, and how addressing mental health at the workplace can improve your diversity and inclusion efforts.  You’ll walk away with concrete tips on how to begin these discussions at your company, and some quick tips for you on how you can “log out” to take care of your own mental health.`,

		description: `From indicating errors to emphasizing a call to action, color can play a critical role in how we communicate with users. But what role does it play in accessibility? In this talk, we'll examine the ways color can improve or detract from an app's usability, and learn to make our apps intuitive, delightful, and informative without relying on color to do all of the heavy lifting. Useful for both designers and developers, this talk will look into a variety of tools we can leverage to create semantic, pleasant applications that serve everyone - not just users with perfect color vision.`
