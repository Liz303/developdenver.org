Hello!

We are excited to announce the call for speakers is out and [ready for submissions](https://developdenver.org/submit-talk)! If you or someone you know has a stellar talk, panel or a lightning talk we are accepting everything so submit your talk today.

We'll only keep this open until midnight on September 15th, and the community will start voting on the talks they want to see soon, so get your idea out there!
