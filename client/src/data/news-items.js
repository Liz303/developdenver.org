Your ticket also includes coffee, breakfast, lunch at Zeppelin Station, afternoon open bar, opening and closing party drinks, and closing party taco bar.

#### Speakers

Our [Call for Speakers](https://developdenver.org/submit-talk) is open until September 22nd. While voting has already started, the Develop Denver team also actively seeks to promote great talks from a wide variety of speakers, so we’re keeping submissions open right until the end. Check back frequently to vote for new talks! If you’d like assistance putting together your proposal, we’re holding submission workshops on [Thursday](https://www.meetup.com/Develop-Denver/events/254558582/) and [Saturday](https://www.meetup.com/Develop-Denver/events/254578772/) this week. All are welcome, and we enthusiastically encourage first-time speakers and anyone from an under-represented group in technology to attend.

#### Sponsors

We still have sponsorship positions available at a variety of levels. We’re offering a lot of new things for sponsors this year that we hope will be valuable for everyone, [so get in touch with us](mailto:hello@developdenver.org) if you’re interested in getting involved!
