Bringing developers and designers together for two days of hands on code & design talks. Putting everyone on a level playing field. Pushing people to step out of their comfort zones to learn and try new things.

Develop Denver has always been about applying creativity to all areas of interactive, be it code styles & techniques, or having a heart to heart with a designer & developer over a bottle of wine in front of a room full of people.
